One may be found in the belly of a dragon, while another in the limbs of a great tree. Regardless of where it\u2019s found, a Griffon\u2019s Saddlebag is typically discovered by an adventurer with a destiny.\\n\\nThe saddlebags are made by a great, six-armed griffon on the Astral Plane. Believed by some to be a demigod of pocket dimensions and craftsmen everywhere, the griffon is a patron of artificers and creators across the multiverse. The griffon creates magical items in its great forge using materials collected from various planes of existence to add to its collection. While no one knows exactly how to contact the griffon, it has a knack for knowing what items are needed by whom.\\n\\nSuperior Holding. This 1-foot-wide bag always weighs 3 pounds, regardless of what\u2019s inside it. It functions as a bag of holding that can only be pierced by another artifact. Placing a bag of holding, handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item inside the extradimensional space created by the saddlebag, or vice versa, destroys the extradimensional item but leaves the saddlebag unharmed. Any item stored within the other extradimensional space is magically moved to the space within the saddlebag instead. If doing so overloads the bag, random contents from either space are scattered in the Astral Plane.\\n\\nMagic Courier. At the GM\u2019s discretion, the saddlebag\u2019s beak opens up to reveal a letter. The magical script can be read by all creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. The note is a delivery request or similar that includes the name of an item as well as either specific or vague descriptions of a person or place. At the bottom of the letter is a price listed in coins or other form of payment, as well as a date or time depending on its urgency.\\n\\nIf the saddlebag is brought to the described person or place within the allotted time, it dispenses the magical item into the hand of the appropriate recipient. If the payment isn\u2019t received by the bag within 1 hour of dispensing the magic item, the item vanishes and is lost. After receiving the payment for an item in this way, the bag\u2019s beak reopens to dispense a reward for the courier.\\n\\nSell Magic Items. The saddlebag has a connection to the griffon\u2019s forge on the Astral Plane. Depending on the magic item, you can sell a magic item to the saddlebag for half the cost of its base price.\\n\\nSpells. The saddlebag has 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the saddlebag, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the following spells from it: detect magic (1 charge), identify (1 charge), or legend lore (5 charges).\\n\\nAdditional Spells. At the GM\u2019s discretion, such as after reaching certain milestones or completing Magic Courier quests, the saddlebag may offer the following additional spells that can be cast from it: blink (3 charges), dimension door (4 charges), divination (4 charges), etherealness (7 charges), fly (3 charges), magnificent mansion (7 charges), plane shift (7 charges), or secret chest (4 charges).\\n\\nSentience. The saddlebag is a sentient chaotic neutral bag with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet.\\n\\nThe bag can speak, read, and understand Common. When in the presence of only creatures it trusts, the bag\u2019s beak moves when it speaks. Otherwise, the bag communicates telepathically with its wearer. The bag can speak and communicate with griffons.\\n\\nPersonality. The bag\u2019s purpose is to carry, collect, and deliver magic items. Different bags have different personalities, but they are for the most part largely pleasant to talk to. Their voices are bird-like and are filled with occasional coos and squawks, and their stitched eyes widen, squint, and move expressively.\\n\\nIf the bag\u2019s wearer or allies fail to fulfill Magic Courier quests, it may stop offering its magic to them. If it does, their items may be lost or inaccessible within the bag, or potentially spat out. While the bag provides the names of item recipients and delivery locations, it doesn\u2019t know any more information than what was provided to it by the astral griffon. Regardless, it does its best to help its wearer and allies find the specified person or location on the letter.\\n\\nDestroying the Griffon\u2019s Saddlebag. While there is no way to permanently destroy the saddlebag, piercing it with an artifact returns it to its place of origin for repair before it\u2019s returned to the multiverse in a new location. Placing a Griffon\u2019s Saddlebag inside the extradimensional space created by another Griffon\u2019s Saddlebag returns both items to their place of origin and sends all the items stored within them to the griffon\u2019s forge on the Astral Plane.","story":"\\"So what do you think it is?\\"\\n\\nThe half-elf held a bag in his hands.

If the value of the coins deposited in the toy is equal to or greater than the cost of the named item, the item magically appears in your hand or at your feet (your choice) and is removed from the parchment. The spent coins are then lost.\\n\\nThe toy remains animated for 5 minutes or until each item has been purchased from the list. When the toy stops animating, any deposited coins that weren\'t spent on the listed items clatter to the ground below it, converting them into smaller denominations as needed, and the parchment turns to dust and is destroyed.\\n\\nAn item purchased from the wind-up merchant disappears after 24 hours, or early if you attempt to sell or trade it to another creature.","story":"\\"What\'cha got for rent today, little guy?\\"","image":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/griffons-saddlebag.appspot.com/o/images%2FxQaLEFy6A%2Fmedium.png?alt=media&token=a79ee945-8de3-43af-bfe6-9051e420a528","imageName":"WindUp-Merchant.png"},{"name":"Windswept Wyvernplate","type":"Armor (half plate)","rarity":"rare","attunement":"Yes","sub":"M","date":"Nov \u02bc18","desc":"This half plate armor seems to grow lighter when you inhale.
